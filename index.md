# KDD 2019 tutorial

## Instructors

- Aristides Gionis, Aalto University
- Polina Rozenshtein, Nordea Data Science Lab

## Motivation

Networks (or graphs) are used to represent and analyze large datasets of objects and their
relations. Typical examples of graph applications come from social networks, traffic networks,
electric power grids, road systems, the Internet, chemical and biological systems, and more.
Naturally, real-world networks have a temporal component: for instance, interactions between
objects have a timestamp and a duration. In this tutorial we will present models and algorithms
for mining temporal networks, i.e., network data with temporal information. We will overview
different models used to represent temporal networks. We will highlight the main differences
between static and temporal networks, and discuss the challenges arising from introducing the
temporal dimension in the network representation. We will present recent papers addressing
the most well-studied problems in the setting of temporal networks, including computation
of centrality measures, motif detection and counting, community detection and monitoring,
event and anomaly detection, analysis of epidemic processes and influence spreading, network
summarization, and structure prediction. Finally, we will discuss some of the current challenges
and open problems in the area, and we will highlight directions for future work.
